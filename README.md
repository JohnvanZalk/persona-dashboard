Personas are fictional characters that represent a segment of a company's customer base. They are one of the most popular marketing tools used today. In a time where people receive tens of emails per day, personas create PERSONAlization that allows companies to get through to customers. 

Leading marketing automation platforms, such as Pardot, do not have built-in visualizations to monitor the health of personas or any customer segments.

This full-stack analytics application leverages the Pardot API as well as Amazon’s RDS and EC2 services, to help companies track their personas’ growth and engagement.
